      <h1>NARUTO</h1>
      Naruto (Japanese: NARUTOナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and
      illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a
      young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming
      the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts 
      the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The
      series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which
      earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award
      the following year, and Naruto (1997). Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's
      magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon
      (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television
      series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in
      Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon
      Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the
      original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500
      episodes. The English dub was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011,
      airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to Adult Swim's
      Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first
      episode. The English dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day.
      Viz Media began streaming the anime series on their streaming service Neon
      Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes, and ended on March 2016, after 338
      episodes. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies
      and twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related
      merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards
      developed by several companies. <br />
